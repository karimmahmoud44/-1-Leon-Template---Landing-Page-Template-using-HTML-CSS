## About The Project

"Leon" is a clean and modern landing page that I built as a practical application of my HTML and CSS skills. The main goal was to convert a static design into a fully functional and responsive website, focusing on mastering modern CSS layout techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures the website looks great on all devices.

    * **CSS Grid** was used to structure the main multi-column layouts in the *Features*, *Services*, and *Portfolio* sections.
    * **Flexbox** was used for alignment and spacing in the *About* section and other smaller components.
* **CSS Variables:** Used for a consistent color palette and easy theme management.

## üß† What I Learned

This project was a fantastic learning experience that helped me solidify my understanding of turning a design into code. Specifically, I gained practical experience in:

* Choosing the right tool for the job by using **CSS Grid** for complex, two-dimensional layouts and **Flexbox** for simpler, one-dimensional arrangements.
* Implementing a "mobile-first" workflow to ensure the design is fully responsive.
* Writing more maintainable and organized code by using **CSS Variables**.

## üå± Reflections & Future Focus

* **Emphasis on Semantic HTML:** While this project heavily utilized `<div>` tags for structure, it highlighted the importance of using semantic HTML5 tags (like `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<header>`). Adopting a "semantic-first" approach will be a key priority in all my upcoming projects to ensure better accessibility and cleaner, more meaningful code.
